# SimpNAS
Manage your hard drives, volumes, network shares, users, groups through an excellent fast Web UI similar to OpenMediaVault, UnRAID and FreeNAS, but with a much more simpler opinionated approach.

## Installation

* Install Debian 12
* Copy and paste the line below into terminal

`curl -fsSL https://get.simpnas.com | bash`

## Notes

* It is mandatory to run the install as root.
* When installing Debian for packages choose only SSH server and standard system utilities.
* This is meant to be installed behind a router not exposed to the internet directly.
